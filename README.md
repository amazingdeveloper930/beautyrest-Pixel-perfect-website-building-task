# Beautyrest Website

For this project, I was tasked with building the website for Beautyrest, a luxury mattress brand. The client provided me with a PSD file, which I then used to create an animated website using CSS and HTML.

My goal was to create a website that would reflect the brand's luxurious and high-quality products. To achieve this, I focused on the visual elements, including the use of high-quality images and typography. I used CSS to create smooth animations and transitions, which added an extra layer of sophistication to the site.

Throughout the project, I communicated regularly with the client to ensure that I was meeting their needs and expectations. I also made sure to test the site thoroughly to ensure that it was user-friendly and worked seamlessly across different devices.

Overall, I am extremely proud of the final product. The Beautyrest website is visually stunning and truly reflects the brand's values and identity. I am confident that this website will help the brand attract and retain customers, and I am thrilled to have been a part of the project.
